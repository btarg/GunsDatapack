# Minecraft Guns Data Pack
## Why a data pack?
Mods are annoying to download and update. I want this to be entirely server-side with no downloads for the clients. I woud also like for it to be compatible with Geyser and Floodgate.
## Not a plugin?
Plugins require more maintenance due to breaking changes to Minecraft and the custom server software, e.g. Paper. They also don't work on vanilla Minecraft servers. Datapacks work across all server softwares and can be easily upgraded with new Minecraft updates.
