# Minecraft Guns Data Pack
## Why a data pack?
Mods are annoying to download and update. I want this to be entirely server-side with no required downloads for clients, other than a resource pack.
## Not a plugin?
Plugins require more maintenance due to breaking changes to Minecraft and the custom server software, e.g. Paper. They also don't work on vanilla Minecraft servers. Datapacks work across all server softwares and can be easily upgraded with new Minecraft updates.
## Bedrock compatibility
Unfortunately, due to the usage of ["offhand detection",](https://youtu.be/Ejg_5l-bR_M) Bedrock players will not be able to reload their weapons. Mojang have insisted on not providing feature parity with Java Edition for years now, and I can't be bothered to work around this. Left-click detection will be used for other functionality later down the line and therefore left clicking will not be used for reloading.
